const faqs = [
  { q: 'How accurate is the SNGPL gas bill calculator?', a: 'Our calculator uses approximate SNGPL residential tariff slab rates for 2024-25 and includes energy charges, fixed charges, infrastructure cess, and GST. The estimate is typically within 5-15% of the actual bill. Actual bills may vary due to OGRA-approved tariff revisions, special surcharges, meter rent, and arrears. Always check your exact bill at the official SNGPL portal.' },
  { q: 'What is HHM in gas billing?', a: 'HHM stands for Hundred Cubic Meters (or sometimes Hundred Cubic Feet depending on region). It is the unit SNGPL uses to measure and bill gas consumption. 1 HHM = 100 cubic meters of natural gas. Your monthly HHM consumption is printed on your gas bill under the "Consumption" or "Units" field. It is calculated by subtracting your previous meter reading from the current reading and dividing by 100.' },
  { q: 'How do I read my SNGPL gas meter?', a: 'Your SNGPL gas meter shows cumulative consumption in cubic meters (m³) or cubic feet. Read the digits displayed on the digital or dial readout. Your current month\'s consumption in HHM is calculated as: (Current Reading - Previous Reading) ÷ 100 = HHM consumed. The meter reader records this monthly, but you can read it yourself to verify your bill.' },
  { q: 'Why do gas bills increase in winter?', a: 'Gas bills increase significantly in winter (November to February) because Pakistani households consume more gas for space heating (gas heaters, room heaters), hot water, and increased cooking time. The same tariff slabs apply, but higher consumption pushes households into higher slab rates, resulting in disproportionately higher bills. A household consuming 1 HHM in summer may consume 4-5 HHM in winter.' },
  { q: 'What are SNGPL tariff slabs?', a: 'SNGPL uses a progressive slab system where the rate per HHM increases with consumption. The system is designed to protect low-income consumers (who consume less) while charging more for excessive use. Rates are set by OGRA and revised periodically. Our calculator uses the approximate 2024-25 residential rates.' },
  { q: 'What is Infrastructure Development Surcharge on gas bills?', a: 'The Infrastructure Development Surcharge (IDS) is a government-mandated levy added to gas bills to fund expansion of Pakistan\'s gas pipeline network. It is calculated as a percentage (approximately 5%) of your gas consumption charges. This charge appears as a separate line item on your bill.' },
  { q: 'How does GST apply to SNGPL bills?', a: 'General Sales Tax (GST) at 17% is applied on the total of gas consumption charges, fixed charges, and infrastructure cess. GST is a federal tax collected by SNGPL on behalf of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). It is clearly shown as a separate line item on every SNGPL bill.' },
  { q: 'Can I use this calculator for commercial connections?', a: 'Our calculator is optimized for domestic (residential) SNGPL connections. Commercial and industrial connections have different, usually higher, tariff rates set by OGRA. Using this calculator for commercial connections will give an underestimate. For commercial bill estimates, contact SNGPL directly at 1199.' },
  { q: 'What is the minimum gas bill for SNGPL?', a: 'Even if you consume zero gas in a month, you will still receive a bill for the fixed monthly charges (approximately PKR 100) plus applicable taxes. This covers the cost of maintaining your gas connection and meter service.' },
  { q: 'How can I dispute a high SNGPL gas bill?', a: 'If you believe your gas bill is incorrect, first use our calculator to estimate the expected amount based on your meter readings. If there is a significant discrepancy: (1) Call SNGPL helpline 1199, (2) Provide your consumer number, (3) Request a meter inspection, (4) File a formal billing complaint. SNGPL will send an officer to verify your meter reading within 7-14 days.' },

          <div className="prose-content">
            <p>Understanding how SNGPL calculates your gas bill empowers you to verify your charges, plan your budget, and identify any billing discrepancies. The billing process involves several steps:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Meter Reading</h3>
            <p>An SNGPL meter reader visits your premises monthly and records the current reading shown on your gas meter. The meter displays cumulative gas consumption in cubic meters (m³) since the meter was installed or last reset.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Consumption Calculation</h3>
            <p>SNGPL calculates your monthly consumption by subtracting the previous reading from the current reading:</p>
            <div className="bg-gray-900 text-green-400 p-4 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm my-4">
              <p>Monthly Consumption (m³) = Current Reading − Previous Reading</p>
              <p className="mt-2 text-yellow-300">Monthly Consumption (HHM) = Monthly Consumption (m³) ÷ 100</p>
            </div>
            <p>For example: If current reading = 5,250 and previous reading = 5,000, then consumption = 250 m³ = 2.5 HHM</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Tariff Slab Application</h3>
            <p>SNGPL applies a progressive slab rate system. This means different portions of your consumption are billed at different rates. The first HHM is billed at the lowest rate, the next HHM at a higher rate, and so on. This protects low-income consumers while discouraging excessive use.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Adding Fixed Charges and Taxes</h3>
            <p>After calculating the energy charge, SNGPL adds:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed monthly charge (regardless of consumption)</li>
              <li>Infrastructure Development Surcharge (% of energy charge)</li>
              <li>GST (17% on subtotal)</li>
              <li>Meter rent (if applicable)</li>
              <li>Previous arrears or advance balance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Bill Generation</h3>
            <p>SNGPL&apos;s billing system generates your bill approximately 3-5 days after the meter reading date. The bill is then posted to your address and made available on the online portal simultaneously.</p>

                <p>Infra Cess      = Energy Charges × 5%</p>
                <p>Sub-total       = Energy + Fixed + Infra Cess</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Locate your gas meter — usually mounted on the outside wall of your home or in a meter box</li>
              <li>Look at the numeric display — it shows cumulative consumption in m³</li>
              <li>Record all digits from left to right</li>
              <li>Ignore any red-colored dials or digits (these are decimal fractions)</li>
              <li>Your previous reading can be found on last month&apos;s gas bill</li>
              <li>Subtract previous from current to get this month&apos;s consumption in m³</li>
              <li>Divide by 100 to convert to HHM</li>
            </ol>

          <div className="prose-content">
            <p>SNGPL&apos;s residential tariff is structured in progressive slabs set by OGRA (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority). Here is the complete rate structure for 2024-25:</p>

            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>

                <tr><td>Slab 2</td><td>1 – 2 HHM</td><td>PKR 400</td><td>~PKR 804</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Slab 3</td><td>2 – 3 HHM</td><td>PKR 600</td><td>~PKR 1,509</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Slab 4</td><td>3 – 4 HHM</td><td>PKR 800</td><td>~PKR 2,448</td></tr>

              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p className="text-xs text-gray-400 mt-2">* Monthly bill estimates include fixed charges, infrastructure cess, and GST. Rates are approximate for 2024-25 and subject to OGRA revision.</p>

            <h3>How Progressive Slab Billing Works</h3>
            <p>Many consumers misunderstand slab billing — they think if they fall in Slab 3, ALL their gas is charged at PKR 600/HHM. This is <strong>incorrect</strong>.</p>
            <p>Progressive billing means:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>first 1 HHM</strong> is always charged at PKR 200 — regardless of total consumption</li>
              <li>The <strong>next 1 HHM</strong> (1-2 HHM) is charged at PKR 400</li>
              <li>Only the consumption <strong>above 2 HHM</strong> is charged at PKR 600, and so on</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So for a household consuming 2.5 HHM: the first 1 HHM costs PKR 200, the next 1 HHM costs PKR 400, and the remaining 0.5 HHM costs PKR 300 (0.5 × 600) = Total gas charge of PKR 900.</p>

            <h3>Lifeline Consumer Category</h3>
            <p>OGRA designates consumers using less than 1 HHM per month as &quot;Lifeline&quot; consumers — typically low-income households. These consumers benefit from the lowest slab rate and in some periods may receive subsidized rates. Check your bill to see if you qualify for this category.</p>

            <p>Gas consumption in Pakistan is highly seasonal, and understanding this pattern helps you budget and plan for higher winter bills:</p>

            <h3>Why Winter Bills Shock Consumers</h3>
            <p>Many Pakistani households are surprised by steep winter gas bills. The reason is the combination of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Higher consumption:</strong> Running room heaters, gas geysers, and more cooking uses 4-6x more gas than summer</li>
              <li><strong>Slab escalation:</strong> Higher consumption pushes into higher slab rates, increasing the per-unit cost</li>
              <li><strong>Compounding effect:</strong> Even a 4x consumption increase can result in a 8-12x bill increase due to progressive tariffs</li>
            </ul>

                { reason: 'Meter Reading Error', detail: 'The meter reader may have made a clerical error. Compare your bill\'s "Previous Reading" with your own recorded reading from last month. If they don\'t match, file a complaint with SNGPL (1199) requesting a re-reading.' },
                { reason: 'Estimated Bill', detail: 'If SNGPL could not read your meter (access denied, reader absent), they generate an estimated bill based on your historical usage. Estimated bills are often higher than actual consumption. Request a proper meter reading at your next opportunity.' },
                { reason: 'Gas Leak', detail: 'An internal gas leak wastes gas you are paying for without actually using it. If consumption appears high but you haven\'t changed your habits, call SNGPL emergency 1199 immediately to inspect for leaks.' },
                { reason: 'Faulty Meter', detail: 'Gas meters can malfunction and show higher readings than actual consumption. Request a meter accuracy test from SNGPL — they will replace the meter and adjust any over-billing if confirmed faulty.' },
                { reason: 'Tariff Revision', detail: 'OGRA periodically revises gas tariffs. If your bill increased without a change in consumption, a tariff revision may have occurred. Check sngpl.com.pk or call 1199 for recent tariff changes.' },
                { reason: 'Accumulated Arrears', detail: 'If previous bills were partially paid or missed, arrears accumulate and are added to current bills, making them appear much higher. Check the arrears section of your bill and settle outstanding balances to normalize billing.' },
